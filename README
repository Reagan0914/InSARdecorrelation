This folder contains MATLAB programs developed for the InSAR decorrelation noise covariance model.

aux_locwithampbackground.m: Mark selected locations in a SAR amplitude map. This program was used to generate Fig2.(2) and (3).

aux_tableofmerits.m: This program was used to generate table 2.

compare_realdata.m: This program was used to generate Fig.5 and Fig. 6.

comparemodels_simulation.m: This program was used to generate Fig.3.

cpx_phase_correlation.m: This program was used to compute Eq. 34

DVstat_igram_analysis_1.m: This program was used to generate Fig. 4 Death Valleycase: data and model predictions of decorrelation phase noise variance after stacking

DVstat_igram_analysis_2.m: This program was used to generate Fig. 2 Death Valley coherence-time plot

mydecorcov.m: This program generates decorrelation covariance matrix using the proposed model

piyushdecorcov.m: This program generates decorrelation covariance matrix using Piyush's model from his paper

simulateSLC.m: This program generates a series of SLCs with given scattering model. Used in cpx_phase_correlation.m.

stat_igram_analysis_1.m: This program was used to generate Fig.4 Cascadia case: data and model predictinos of decorrelation phase noise variance after stacking

stat_igram_analysis_2.m: This program was used to generate Fig.2 Cascadia coherence-time plot.
